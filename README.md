**NEmo: A wildfire smoke detection benchmark**
========
PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **NEMO** (**NE**vada s**mo**ke detection benchmark).

### Temporary instructions
Connor, please put all the code cleaned and named properly (**NOT** based on WIDER face anymore) but based on our own thing. 
Make sure to complete this README file in a way that literally if I cloned this to my computer and simply followed your instructions I can replicate it.

make sure to include sections to:
- train a new model (plz include the training and validatoin bbox files)
Plz Dont upload the entire data 
- 

location wise, things in the repository must be in a way that works out of the box after cloning the environment. Create the repository and its readme file in a way that you could use it to set everything up in another computer and actually test that it works.

For your computing environment, you can provide the spec-list of the conda environment that you used to run the successful final experiments.
under your conda environment do this command
```
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```


Christina and Yongyi can also help write a section about the data preparation.
