**NEmo: A wildfire smoke detection benchmark**
========
PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **NEMO** (**NE**vada s**mo**ke detection benchmark).


Connor, please put all the code cleaned and named properly (note based on WIDER face anymore) but based on our own thing. 
Make sure to complete this README file in a way that literally if I cloned this to my computer and simply followed your instructions I can replicate it.

location wise, things in the repository must be in a way that works out of the box after cloning the environment. Create the repository and its readme file in a way that you could use it to set everything up in another computer and actually test that it works.

For your computing environment, you can provide the spec-list of the conda environment that you used to run the successful final experiments.
under your conda environment do this command
```
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```


Christina and Yongyi can also help write a section about the data preparation.
